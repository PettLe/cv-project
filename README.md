This project is all about using ReactJS.

NOTE TO SELF: Maybe just opt out from using the separate infoOutput and use only the forms.
When submitted, render. And add edit button which returns all the input fields for edit.
Maybe have the output always (but as hidden) in the personal.js. And submit hides the input field.
