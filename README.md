This project is all about using ReactJS.

Waaay too many DIVs. It just got really complicated, really fast..

I just can't handle editing inputs when there are multiple educations or jobs. It always changes both of the values. In the end though
I did find a solution of sorts. Had to self-study hooks a bit for that to work.
Maybe that's why apparently many other students opted to make a CV application which takes only one school and job. I can see why.

This was weird combination of hard and easy. Basic idea of React (after been on this project for a week) is pretty simple, easy and
intuitive. But there's still so much more to learn and being a new concept implementing it was trial and error.
